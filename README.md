Iron Server!! what is this name..?
===========================
Since it executes Iron Languages Scripts on the system and serves the output..

About the Project
-----------------
Iron Server is an application for experimental/demonstration purpose. The aim of the project is allowing you to the  access the information from your computer from anywhere(Public Hosted Website,Twitter,Facebook,web mails ) by simply sending some Iron language's(IronPython, IronRuby) scripts/DOS commands. Infact you can control the PC depending on the Scripts you send.

Why to use Iron Server
----------------------

To communicate/connect two personal computers you need a Server between them to get access and forward the data.Firewalls often block direct connections and it is not possible for most of the people to have internet-connections with static IP address. Many people think why should i use Iron Server application if there are things like Remote Desktop/VNC & Other softwares. To use these, you still need the IP-Address and need an open port for being able to use these technologies. Iron Server application doesn't need any open ports. Firewalls simply assume that you are browsing a website OR using twitter OR using a web mail. The application doesn't require any installation you can just copy the .NET EXE & supporting DLLS.

Software Requirements
---------------------

.NET Framework 4.0
Iron Languages DLLS ( Available with download Iron Python , Iron Ruby)

Attention!!! 

 My intention is not to Create/Demonstrate a Malware with this application using .NET
Iron Server allows the execution of Iron Languages on your computer. Bad scripts can read/modify/delete your data and to destroy your system. The code can be easily customized to create Zombie Servers. As the application is written in C# & .NET, generally the Attack Surface for a Hacker may be less due to the other dependencies. But it is completely dependent on the execution environment. As mentioned previously code can be customized depending on the needs and can be easily turned into a Malware application to generate different type of payloads. Current Day Anti virus Scanners cannot understand such payloads. 

The best way to use this application is with a reliable and secure source.
